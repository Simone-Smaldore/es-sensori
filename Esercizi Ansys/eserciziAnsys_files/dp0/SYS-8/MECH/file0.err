 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.391   TIME= 17:58:10
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.391   TIME= 17:58:10
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.391   TIME= 17:58:10
 Contact element 427 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of        
 underlying base element 259.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,   
 but checking for this is discontinued.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.406   TIME= 17:58:10
 Maximum contact stiffness 5.156971667E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.734   TIME= 17:58:10
 The eigenproblem is ill-conditioned (relative residual from test linear 
 solve: 1.682808E-02).  The accuracy of the solution may not be          
 satisfactory.  Modifying the initial value of the frequency shift       
 (FREQB in the MODOPT command) or changing the boundary conditions of    
 the model might solve the problem.
