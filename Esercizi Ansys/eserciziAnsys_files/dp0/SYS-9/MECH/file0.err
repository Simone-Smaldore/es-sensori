 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.531   TIME= 18:00:45
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.562   TIME= 18:00:45
 Contact element 427 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of        
 underlying base element 259.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,   
 but checking for this is discontinued.

 Maximum contact stiffness 5.156971667E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.
