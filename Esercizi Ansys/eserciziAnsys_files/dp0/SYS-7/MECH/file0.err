 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.500   TIME= 16:58:25
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.531   TIME= 16:58:25
 Contact element 274 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of        
 underlying base element 2.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,     
 but checking for this is discontinued.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.531   TIME= 16:58:25
 Maximum contact stiffness 4.560343321E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.
